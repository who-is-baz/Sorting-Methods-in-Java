# Sorting Methods in Java

This project was developed in **Java** to teach and visualize different **sorting algorithms**. It is designed for students who want to understand both the logic and structure of each method, applying the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

## 🚀 How to run the program

### Option 1 – Run in IntelliJ IDEA
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/who-is-baz/Sorting-Methods-in-Java.git
Import the project into IntelliJ IDEA.

Compile and run the main class Main.java.

Select from the menu the sorting method you want to visualize.

Option 2 – Run in Visual Studio Code
If you don’t want to use IntelliJ, you can run the program in Visual Studio Code with the following extensions:

Extension Pack for Java (by Microsoft)

Debugger for Java

Java Test Runner

Maven for Java (optional but recommended)

Steps:

Install the extensions above from the VS Code marketplace.

Open the project folder in VS Code.

Make sure you have JDK 17+ installed and configured in your PATH.

Open Main.java and click Run ▶.

📚 Implemented Sorting Methods
🔹 Bubble Sort
Function: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Theme: Bubble animation rising in water.

Pros: Very easy to understand.

Cons: Very inefficient for large lists.

🔹 Selection Sort
Function: Finds the minimum value and places it at the beginning, repeating for the rest.

Theme: Simulates picking objects one by one.

Pros: Fewer swaps compared to Bubble Sort.

Cons: Inefficient for large lists.

🔹 Insertion Sort
Function: Inserts elements into the correct position within an already sorted list.

Theme: Similar to arranging playing cards in your hand.

Pros: Efficient for small lists.

Cons: Slow for large lists.

🔹 Merge Sort
Function: Divides the list into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them.

Theme: Pac-Man style animation with pills.

Pros: Very efficient with large datasets.

Cons: Requires extra memory.

🔹 Quick Sort
Function: Selects a pivot and partitions the list into sublists of smaller and larger elements recursively.

Theme: Fast cutting and partitioning simulation.

Pros: One of the fastest in practice.

Cons: Performance can degrade with already sorted lists.

🧑‍💻 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Usage
Classes & Objects: Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate class.

Inheritance: Common structures are reused between algorithms.

Polymorphism: Multiple sorting methods can be executed from the same interface.

Encapsulation: Internal details of each algorithm are hidden, making them easier to use.

🎨 Extras
Visual interface: Each algorithm has a unique animated theme for better engagement.

Educational purpose: Designed to learn sorting in a fun and interactive way.

Collaborative project: Developed by Baz, Oswaldo, and team for the Software Quality Topics course.
